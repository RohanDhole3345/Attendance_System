# Location Based Attendance System

## Project Description
The Location Based Attendance System is a web-based application designed to prevent proxy attendance.
It allows attendance to be marked only when a user is physically present inside a predefined classroom location.

The system uses:
- GPS-based location verification
- Admin-controlled classroom boundary setup
- Secure user and admin login system
